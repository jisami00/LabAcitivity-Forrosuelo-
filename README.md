# Problem 1
I created the program by first making it ask the user to enter two positive integers. Then, I added a condition so that the program will not accept zero or negative inputs. 
After that, I wrote a recursive function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD), which I used to compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM). Finally, I displayed the result, showing 
the smallest number that both inputs can divide evenly.

# Problem 2
I created the program to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion. The program asks for the number of disks and then shows step-by-step how to move all the disks from the first rod to the target rod, 
following the rules of the game. I used a recursive function where the program first moves the smaller disks to the helper rod, then moves the largest disk, and finally moves the smaller disks again on top of it.
This shows the complete process of transferring the disks in the correct order.
